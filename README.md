# SetGame
Implementing the Set game using Java programming.

## Description:

As part of my academic program , I had the opportunity to work on a project that required the implementation of the game SET in Java language. 

I leveraged my skills in Java programming and my knowledge of threading to develop this project. The outcome of this project was a comprehensive and efficient game that accurately mimics the gameplay of the popular card game SET. 

This experience allowed me to deepen my understanding of the concepts - threads, synchronization and improve my programming skills.
